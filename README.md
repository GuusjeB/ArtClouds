# ArtClouds

## Project description
We created a visualisation for artwork which can be interactively explored by the user. 
When an artist's name hasbeen entered in the search bar, the artwork of that artist will be displayed in a node. 
All sizes are relative to each other. Multiple artists can be compared by entering more artists in the search bar.

Artists can be clustered based on the year they were most active by clicking on one of the three buttons in the top.

Clicking on a node will trigger the zoom function, such that art can be closer inspected. Clicking on individual artworks will reveal a sidebar with additional information.
