## Project description
We created a visualisation for artwork which can be interactively explored by the user. 
When an artist's name hasbeen entered in the search bar, the artwork of that artist will be displayed in a cloud. The artwork is displayed based on a wordcloud design.
All sizes are relative to each other, this makes it possible to have a look at the choice of painting sizes of various artist. 
Multiple artists can be compared by entering more artists in the search bar.

</p>

Clicking on a cloud will trigger the zoom function, such that art can be closer inspected. Clicking on individual artworks will reveal a sidebar with additional information. The sidebar contains a button to view the image in full resolution.

Artist clouds can be clustered by year by clicking on one of the three buttons in the top. Clouds can be clustered by before and after 1900, and before and after 1945.

If the screen gets too full, clouds can be deleted by holding shift while clicking on a cloud.
